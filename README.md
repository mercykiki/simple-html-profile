# simple-html-profile


Welcome to my first HTML project ‚Äî a personal website created as I begin my journey into web development and cybersecurity.

##  What You'll Find
This website includes:
- **Home Page**: A brief intro and background image
- **Hobbies**: Things I love doing in my free time
- **Favorites**: Food, music, travel and photography choices
- **Contact Me**: A form where you can get in touch

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS3
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)

##  Purpose
This project was created to:
- Practice HTML basics like lists, links, tables, forms
- Style a full-page layout with custom CSS
- Prepare for backend connection using PHP or Flask
- Host a live version on GitHub Pages

## Live Link

##  Coming Soon
In the next phase, I‚Äôll connect the contact form to a real email backend using Python Flask.
